# Dot Game
In this game, a dot moves from the top to the bottom of the screen. A player tries to click on the dot and receives points when they are successful.


## Play the Game!

- The Start button changes to a Pause button, which should pause the game until the button is touched or clicked again.
- The dot falls at a constant rate. A player can use a slider to control the rate at which the dot falls, with a range of 10-100 pixels per second.
- The dot appears at a random horizontal position at the top of the box every second.
- The dot will vary randomly in size from 10px in diameter to 100px in diameter.
- The dot's value is inversely proportional to its size, with the smallest dot worth 10 points, and the largest dot worth 1 point.
- When a player touches or clicks a dot, the dot should disappear from the box, and the score should be increased based on the dot's value.
